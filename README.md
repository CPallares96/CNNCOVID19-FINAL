# CNNCOVID19-FINAL
A default neural network from a convolutional neural network.
Execute the code by only pressing the run button in MATLAB, the code is running by default for Non-infected people,
it is refered in the third line of code by root="C:\Users\Clon\Desktop\JELPU\CNN-COVID19-master\Non Covid\TODO",and
with the condition at line 301 saying "r>1", if want to refer to infected people, then only change "Non Covid" in the 
last directory to "Yes Covid", remember to change the other folders depending where the project was donwloaed in your
computer. Each diferent execution will show an histograman refering to the same histograms in the report.
